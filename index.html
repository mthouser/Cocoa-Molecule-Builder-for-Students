<a id="history" class="anchor" href="#history" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h2>

<p>Back in 1997, I worked with a group from the University of Michigan called Hi-CE to create a three-dimensional molecule modeling program for high-school students. It started as a programming class project, and then became part of the Hi-CE lab product line. The itent was to take some of the capabilities of advanced chemistry tools and provide a scaffolded version that students could quickly pick up and use. The program was originally written in C++ for MacOS ("classic", I believe MacOS 7.5.x at the time) by a great programmer named Drew Thaler and me. It was originally derived from an open source program called RasMol.  </p>

<p>Due to concerns of Apple's eroding marketshare and the emergence of PCs, in addition to Mac in schools, we re-wrote the application from scratch in the fledging Java platform. </p>

<p>I graduated before I had a chance to completely finish the program. The basic features were there like the ability to construct a molecule and compare various rednerings of the molecule side-by-side. We got started on implementing features like retrieving molecular properties (boiling point, etc) based on the constructed molecules, but it remained somewhat incomplete.  Nonetheless, the program was used by a number of educators, even 10+ years after development and maintenance stopped on the project. </p>

<p>I would like to learn Swift programming, though I haven't done any iOS programming, let alone MacOS X programming. When thinking about a good project to tackle for the learning experience, I thought back to eChem. I thought it would be a great program to bring something like that to a touch screen device. The iPad would be a great platform for this type of application. </p>

<p>I am also interested in learning more about functional programming concepts, and therefore am liberally applying techniques such as immutable data objects, recursion / map / reduce vs iteration, closures to customize behavior vs subclassing, etc.   </p>

<p>I will be building this project as a hobby, at a very slow pace undoubtedly. The source is here. Please contact me if you have any interest in this project, whether to contrbute code, knowledge of chemistry (I had only one inorganic chem class in college, so I could use the help), or knowledge of teaching and helping students use technology to learn, please let me know. Just create an issue for this project with your interest to let me know.</p>
